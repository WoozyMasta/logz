[h1]LogZ - Structured Logging for DayZ[/h1]

[b]Where to install:[/b] [u]server only[/u].
Do [i]not[/i] install on clients - it does nothing on the client.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]What it is[/h2]
A structured logging mod for DayZ servers that writes events in NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON) format. Unlike standard textual .ADM or .RPT logs which are hard to parse, LogZ produces machine-readable logs rich in context (coordinates, HP, SteamIDs, inventory state, damage types).
Designed to be ingested by ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Loki, Graylog, or VictoriaLogs.

It focuses on server analytics and player behavior statistics rather than just error reporting. Ideal for building detailed dashboards to track player activity, combat, and economy.

[b]Does not change gameplay[/b] and adds no items or loot.

[h2]Quick install[/h2]
[olist]
[]Add the mod to your DayZ server load order: [code]-servermod=@LogZ[/code]

[*]Configure your log collector (Promtail, Filebeat, Vector) to tail this file
[/olist]

[h2]Log Collectors Configuration[/h2]
When setting up [b]Promtail[/b], [b]Fluent Bit[/b], or [b]Vector[/b], ensure you parse the JSON line.
We recommend using the following root fields as [b]Labels (Tags)[/b] for efficient filtering:
[list]
[] instance (Server ID)
[] world (Map Name)
[] level (Severity)
[] event_type (e.g. "player.kill", "chat")
[/list]

[b]Important:[/b] Use the ts field (Unix epoch seconds) as the timestamp source to keep logs accurate even if the collector lags.
