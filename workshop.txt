[h1]LogZ - Structured Logging for DayZ[/h1]

[b]Where to install:[/b] [u]server only[/u].
Do [i]not[/i] install on clients - it does nothing on the client.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]What it is[/h2]
A structured logging mod for DayZ servers that writes events in NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON) format. Unlike standard textual .ADM or .RPT logs which are hard to parse, LogZ produces machine-readable logs rich in context (coordinates, HP, SteamIDs, inventory state, damage types).
Designed to be ingested by ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Loki, Graylog, or VictoriaLogs.

It focuses on server analytics and player behavior statistics rather than just error reporting. Ideal for building detailed dashboards to track player activity, combat, and economy.

[b]Does not change gameplay[/b] and adds no items or loot.

[h2]Who it’s for[/h2]
[list]
[*]Server owners who want to visualize player activity and combat in Grafana or Kibana
[*]Admins needing detailed, searchable evidence for investigations (cheaters, abuse)
[*]DevOps enthusiasts building a professional monitoring stack
[/list]

[h2]Key points[/h2]
[list]
[*][b]Server-only[/b] - players don’t need the mod
[*][b]Structured Data[/b] - every line is a valid JSON object
[*][b]Rich Context[/b] - logs include positions, distance, specific body part hit, ammo type, and hierarchy
[*][b]Performance[/b] - optimized serialization, damage thresholds, and event throttling (e.g., rapid fire)
[*][b]Log Rotation[/b] - built-in file rotation to prevent disk overflow
[*][b]Integrations[/b] - native support for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3594119002]MetricZ[/url] and DayZ-Expansion-AI

[h2]Quick install[/h2]
[olist]
[*]Add the mod to your DayZ server load order: [code]-servermod=@LogZ[/code]
[*]Start the server - log file appears at: [code].../profiles/logz.ndjson[/code]
[*]Configure your log collector (Promtail, Filebeat, Vector) to tail this file
[/olist]

[h2]Log Collectors Configuration[/h2]
When setting up [b]Promtail[/b], [b]Fluent Bit[/b], or [b]Vector[/b], ensure you parse the JSON line.
We recommend using the following root fields as [b]Labels (Tags)[/b] for efficient filtering:
[list]
[*] instance (Server ID)
[*] world (Map Name)
[*] level (Severity)
[*] event_type (e.g. "player.kill", "chat")
[/list]

[b]Important:[/b] Use the ts field (Unix epoch seconds) as the timestamp source to keep logs accurate even if the collector lags.

[h2]Complete your stack with MetricZ[/h2]
To get the full picture, use [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3594119002]MetricZ[/url][/b] alongside LogZ.
[list]
[*] [b]LogZ[/b] tracks [i]logs[/i] (Detailed events, combat history, economy flows)
[*] [b]MetricZ[/b] tracks [i]metrics[/i] (Server FPS, total entity counts, vehicle numbers)
[/list]
Together they allow you to visualize not just [i]what[/i] happened, but how it impacted server performance (e.g., did that massive explosion drop the FPS?).
